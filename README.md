#Build Instructions

Tested with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) 0.8.3 using Gradle 0.12.1 on OSX 10.9.4

##Prerequsites and setup
- you must have the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) and the Android SDK, which comes bundled with Android Studio or [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) with ADT) installed.
- in `BUILD.sh` modify the ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK vars to point to the Android NDK and SDK directories on your system.
- Before attempting to  build from Android Studio, you must run `bash build.sh` at least once. This will set some required environment variables and 
build the app's NDK and C++ dependencies from `/jni` into `/libs` for inclusion in the apk packaging.
- use 'bash BUILD.sh' for signed release builds. Debug builds can be generated by Android Studio or by modifying the build command in `/.build-release/android-build.sh` and running `bash BUILD.sh`


### known TODOs
- test backwards compatibility with eclipse, Windows and Linux based builds to prepare for public release
- add `ndk-build` into gradle build
